# Risk of Heart Disease

The "Risk of Heart Disease" project aims to analyze the risk of heart diseases based on clinical and health data of patients. Using a dataset containing various health-related variables such as age, sex, cholesterol, resting electrocardiogram, among others, we explore different classification methods to predict the risk of heart diseases.
Data Analysis and Modeling

We begin with an exploratory data analysis to better understand the data's characteristics and identify potential patterns. Next, we apply various classification methods such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to determine which model performs best in predicting the risk of heart diseases.

Following the comparative analysis of different models, we select the best classifier for implementation in the graphical user interface.
Graphical User Interface (GUI)

We develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using the PySimpleGUI library, allowing users to input their health data and receive a prediction of the risk of heart diseases based on the selected model. The GUI provides an intuitive and user-friendly experience for interacting with the model, making it more accessible to use and understand the results.
How to Run the Project

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Ensure you have Python installed in your environment.
    Install project dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Run the heart_disease.py file to start the graphical interface.
    Input the requested health data and receive the prediction of the risk of heart diseases.
